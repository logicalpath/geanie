To insert nodes and relationships that are defined
in a file with cypher commands:


cat commandFile | neo4j/bin/neo4j-shell -path /path/to/graphf.db

Note: Neo4j must be stopped while this command is run.

Indexing properties is not automatic in 1.9:

Antonio,
for the current autoindexing to pick up existing data, you need to run an
update on the properties, e.g. name by updating all nodes with
name-properties, something like

http://console.neo4j.org/r/pwdfpn

start n =node(*)
where n.name! <> null
with n as named
set named.name = named.name
return named;
