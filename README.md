# geanie is a prototype for a Genealogy Graph using Neo4j & Node.js

This is a first go at building a node app that talks to Neo4j. It is in
its infancy!

Note that [Neo4j] (http://www.neo4j.org/download) is required for this app to run.  To install this app:
    npm install


Thanks to this app (http://node-neo4j-template.com/)

For helping me get started.
